With AIEP, APA \r\n            seeks to create a new, fun way for youth to engage with the Bible, \r\n            because the KJV translation of the Bible may be difficult for them \r\n            to understand. Ancient Path Adventures AR Education Aid is the \r\n            mobile-friendly web app portion of the AIEP, which is accessed by \r\n            scanning a QR code. The web app contains module quizzes associated \r\n            with student accounts and leaderboards and provides a place for \r\n            facilitators to track students’ progress, assign new modules, and \r\n            award students through the program. Talpha Harris, our client and \r\n            founder of APA, wants to provide engaging tools for people seeking \r\n            God’s heart to understand the mysteries of His Word better. This \r\n            project carries the important message of the Gospel: that Jesus Christ, \r\n            the Son of God, took upon flesh and came down from heaven to reunite \r\n            us with him by taking upon our punishment of death, thus ultimately \r\n            defeating sin through dying on the cross. This message is important \r\n            to all, including children. The primary goals of the Ancient Path \r\n            Adventures AR Education Aid is to produce a website that will connect \r\n            the books APA creates with their online quizzes and videos. The web \r\n            app, based on subscription tier, will also allow teachers to create/modify \r\n            their own modules to cater the content towards their needs.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </header>\r\n      <div className=\"title\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          This site is used to display the work done by a group of UNC Computer Science students \r\n          on a project assigned to them in one of their upper level COMP classes.
